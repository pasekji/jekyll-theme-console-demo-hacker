# Who am I?! 

Hi, I'm Jiri Pasek - twentytwo years old Czech Technical University student and hopefully future cyber security expert. I was into various technologies all my life, so I've decided to study Informatics, Computer science etc.. Programming, problem solving, developing and learning new things are some of my passions.

If you want to learn something about my skills, get in touch with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pasekjiri/)!
